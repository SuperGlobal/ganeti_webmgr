Ganeti Web Manager
==================

|gwm| is a Django_ based web frontend for managing Ganeti_ virtualization clusters. Since Ganeti only provides a command-line interface, |gwm|'s goal is to provide a user friendly web interface to Ganeti via Ganeti's :ref:`Remote API <rapi>`. On top of Ganeti it provides a permission system for managing access to clusters and virtual machines, an in browser VNC console, and vm state and resource visualizations. You can see a few screenshots :ref:`here <screenshots>`.

If you don't already have a Ganeti cluster setup, these directions_ can help you get started.

If you are looking for support, please :ref:`contact us <contact>`.

If you are looking to deploy |gwm| for the first time, check out our :ref:`installation` guide.

If you already have a |gwm| instance running it might be time to :ref:`upgrade <upgrading>`.

Finally, if you would like to report a bug or request a feature, please :ref:`file an issue <issues>`.

|gwm| is licensed under the :ref:`GPLv2 <license>`. It is currently developed and maintained by the Oregon State University Open Source Lab and a handful of volunteers. If you would like to get involved in development see our :ref:`development <development>` guide.
