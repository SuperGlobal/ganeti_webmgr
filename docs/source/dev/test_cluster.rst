Vagrant Test Cluster
====================

For development we use Vagrant to set up a Ganeti Cluster to test on.

Setup
~~~~~

The Vagrant Test cluster is not included with |gwm|. It is a separate
repository that must be cloned::

    git clone https://github.com/osuosl/vagrant-ganeti

Once you've cloned the repository you can refer to its  `README
<https://github.com/osuosl/vagrant-ganeti>`_ for more details  on how to use it.

Updating
~~~~~~~~

If you already have the repository, you should also always make sure you are
running the most up to date version of the code. There are two ways to do this::

    git pull
    git submodule update --init

Or you can simply use the update script in the repo which does the previous
two commands::

    ./update

Either way will work, but make sure that both the repository **and** the
submodules are updated.

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

The vagrant-ganeti project comes with 3 Ganeti nodes which can be used for
testing deployment of VMs. You typically only need **1 node** unless you are
testing multi-node operations.

- You can bring up the first node by typing ``vagrant up node1``.

- The other nodes can be brought up the same way, just swap out ``node1`` with
  ``node2`` or ``node3``.

You can also bring up every node by using just ``vagrant up``, however if you
do not have much RAM or you are already running memory intensive programs, this
should be avoided.


Using with |gwm|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have ``node1`` running, you can add it to |gwm| by using the `add
cluster` button on the cluster page.

The hostname field should be filled in with the IP Address for the given
node, which can be found in the Vagrantfile. The *username* and *password* are
both **vagrant**, which will let you communicate with the cluster.
